### Ventilator-Pressure_Prediction

This is for STAT8017 project in HKU, althogh the project is done, but there is something still valuable to go further...

#### Dataset

The dataset is released by Google brain in kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ventilator-pressure-prediction/data

I only used the train.csv which contains over 6 million records. And I have uploaded to my Google Drive.

You can download the dataset by the following command:

'''
python main.py --dataset_download
